preface:
this is for coding...
it's best to obey some principles when coding.

initialize function pointer is better than initialize function;
K.I.S.S;
one function one function;
provide interface but don't provide how to complete a job;

20171212
if some functions with similar function, need a macro to define a function name;
return 0 when function operates normally, return -1 when function operates fail;
when some bad things happen, need go to revert what we have done before in this function;

"goto error;" 
error handle must at the last(after success return) 

/*
error1:
printf("reason or status\n"); 
return ERROR_NUM;

error2:
printf("reason or status\n");
return ERROR_NUM;
*/
